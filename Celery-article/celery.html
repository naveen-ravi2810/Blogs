                <h3>Why this Post ?</h3>
                <p>
                    Most of the time I browse to others github I found a new command  
                    <span id="command"> celery -A celery_worker worker --pool=solo --loglevel=info</span>
                    from other github. <br/>
                    I just gone through it. And Found zero use case in my small projects.
                    <br/>
                    Finally today [19th March 2024] I had time to use it in my project.

                <h3>The Problem I faced</h3>
                <p>
                    In my Application there is an endpoint to send otp to the particular email for their registration.
                    It worked on my Localhost well and takes <span style="font-weight: bold;">5.94sec</span> <span>as refered in figure 1.2</span>. But this time
                    I felt bad that wheather the user need to wait for 5 sec for the server process. So Their come the 
                    use of <a href="https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/" target="_blank">celery</a> .
                </p>

                <p>
                    This <a href="https://github.com/naveen-ravi2810/Conduct_Backend" target="_blank">application</a> was written 
                    in <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/" target="_blank">FastAPI</a>. with it own in build <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/" target="_blank">Pydantic</a>
                    and the same <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiangolo/" target="_blank">developer</a>'s <a href="https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/" target="_blank">SQLModel</a>. 
                    I used <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> as main Database and <a href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank">Redis</a> as a cache memory.
                    The Email Verification Endpoint with the function is present in Above figure 1.3 and figure 1.4 respectively.
                </p>
                <h4>Finally getting in to send_otp() function</h4>

                <p style="text-align: center;;">Figure 1.5</p>
                <p>
                    And there you can find <i>Email_sender_id</i> which sends the email to the user.
                    <i>Email_sender_password</i> is which the smtp provider gives the passcode for the particular email.
                    There we can find open a html file named <b>otp_template.html</b> which has the mail template that should be send to the user.
                    According to application hierarchy** from <b>Backend</b> directory. 
                </p>

                <h3>Celery helps</h3>
                <p>Celery helps me to make the response for the <b>/email_verification</b> endpoint.
                    As celery takes response for being a broker and assigning task to the redis.
                    <br/>
                    and I can see the task details in <a href="https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">flower</a>.
                    <h3>Let see the celery code and know more about it.</h3>

                    <p>
                        This is tthe update code of figure 1.4 which has configuration without celery. Now the updated code has a new 
                        method <b>delay</b> during the send_otp function call.
                        This make call to the below altered send_otp function with celery config refered in below figure 1.7.

                                        using the celery_app decorator with method task which I initialzed in previous step 2.
                                        after that the function call the another function send_email with the parameter email and otp.
                                        once the OTP is send to the new_user_email address the otp is stored in redis_cache which is another redis_db.

                                        As I told early in step 3 the send_email function carry email and otp as paramter . 
                                        and it send email to the user by starting SMTP server and with the template in otp_template.html file.
                                        Here is the email sending setup with smtplib using python .
                                    </p>
                                </td>
                            </tr>


                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                </p>
            </div>


            <div>
                <h3>Final output / Result</h3>
                <p>
                    Now the application is start after the setting up of .env files with neccessary file.
                    And the same command that I provided early was entered by me. <br> <br>
                    <span id="command">uvicorn main:app --reload</span> <br> <br> to start the application <br> <br>
                    <span id="command"> celery -A app.modules.utils worker --pool=solo --loglevel=info</span> <br> <br>** to start celery_worker according my path directory. <br> <br>
                    <span id="command"> celery -A app.core.celery_worker flower --port=5555</span> <br> <br> start flower in port 5555 to visualize the task status. <br> <br>


                    After sending request to <b>/email_verification</b> endpoint. I found the response time as <b>44.53 ms</b> as referred in below figure 1.8 which is <b>0.88%</b> faster than response which used used without celery.
                </p>
                <img width="100%" src="./assets/time_for_with_celery.png" alt="time_for_with_celery"/>
                <br>
                <p>Hence the response is faster but the email recieve from the smtp service provider will be the same😊😊. </p>

                <p>The good is the server can send response faster and the user no need to wait from the response.</p>
